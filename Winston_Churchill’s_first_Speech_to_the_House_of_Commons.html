            On Friday evening last I received His Majesty's commission to form a new Administration.

        <span pid="3" sid="2">
            It as the evident wish and will of Parliament and the nation that this should be conceived on the broadest possible basis and that it should include all parties, both those who supported the late Government and also the parties of the Opposition.

		  <span pid="4" sid="1">I have completed the most important part of this task.</span>
		  <span pid="4" sid="2">A War Cabinet has been formed of five Members, representing, with the Opposition Liberals, the unity of the nation.</span>
		  <span pid="4" sid="3">The three party Leaders have agreed to serve, either in the War Cabinet or in high executive office.</span>
		  <span pid="4" sid="4"> The three Fighting Services have been filled.</span>
		  <span pid="4" sid="4">It was necessary that this should be done in one single day, on account of the extreme urgency and rigour of events.</span>
		  <span pid="4" sid="5">A number of other positions, key positions, were filled yesterday and I am submitting a further list to His Majesty to-night.</span>
      <span pid="4" sid="6">I hope to complete the appointment of the principal Ministers during to-morrow.</span>
      <span pid="4" sid="7">the appointment of the other Ministers usually takes a little longer, but I trust that, when Parliament meets again, this part of my task will be completed, and that the administration will be complete in all respects.</span>
